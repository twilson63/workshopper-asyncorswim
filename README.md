# Async or Swim Workshoppe (Learn Async)

Welcome to the Async or Swim Workshoppe!

This workshop is to give you small exercises to get familiar with async.js on nodejs. 

> Async is a utility module which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with asynchronous JavaScript.

This workshoppe will walk you through the async api and give you simple examples of each of the functions, it is designed so you may skip around and only practice what you want.

## Background

Async.js was created by Caolan McMahon.  Async provides around 20 functions that include the usual 'functional' suspects (map, reduce, filter, each…) as well as some common patterns for asynchronous control flow (parallel, series, waterfall…). All these functions assume you follow the node.js convention of providing a single callback as the last argument of your async function.

## Situation

Asyncorswim is created to help javascript students to practice using the async functions without having to build full applications and hopefully get a solid idea of their powerful functionality.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have NodeJS and NPM installed see [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org), then npm install downunder and run downunder in a console and your ready to go.  

Also you will want to install async in your project directory.

```
npm install downunder -g
npm install async
asyncorswim
```

Follow the adventures...

Have Fun!

## Recommendations

I recommend creating a play directory and then naming each program by exercise: 1.js 2.js etc...
